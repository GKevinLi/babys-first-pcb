It's a custom ESP32 devboard. It was designed to be a drone flight controller, but it's suitable for other projects as well.
I wanted to make this because I thought it was a good idea to try to design a drone with custom electronics. Turns out, electronics are hard, so I just made this.
It'll go on the drone when all the other parts are done.

## Features
- Integrated gyro and accelerometer (MPU-6050)
- Voltage Regulator that drops drone battery voltage (14.8v) to 5v
- ESP32 Chip for processing, wifi, and bluetooth connectivity
- USB-C 2.0 port for programming and power supply
- Boot and Reset buttons
- A whole lotta GPIO pins
